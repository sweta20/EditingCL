How can parents beat the "time bind"? Rather than merely cultivating time-saving skills-a remedy that, by itself, may even further compress time spent with children-Robinson and Godbey recommend that parents ﬁnd ways to meld time-saving with time-savoring.

Authoritative parenting, whether assessed through direct observation or older children's ratings of their parents' communication, is linked to many aspects of competence. In early childhood, it predicts positive mood, self-conﬁdence and independence in mastery of new tasks, cooperativeness, and resistance to engaging in disruptive behavior.

Vygotsky, who studied and wrote about children's development in Russia in the early twentieth century, was deeply interested in how interdependency-children's close ties to their community-can pave the way to competence and autonomy. His sociocultural theory has thoroughly collectivist cultural roots.
