Just when you thought it was safe to assume that we now know all we are ever likely to know about the past, someone digs another hole and unearths ( literally or figuratively ) some ancient artifact: one day it is a fragile scroll, found in a cave near the Dead Sea, that turns out to be pre- Biblical; the next day it is an entire terracotta army of Chinese soldiers: the next it is a skull, excavated from the Olduvai Gorge, that compels anthropologists ( once again ) to revise their guesses about the earliest stages of Homo sapiens sapiens vs hominids. Most of the relies from the past are gone forever, destroyed by the plows of countless generations of farmers, reduced to rubble by erosion, by conquerors, by prehistoric ( and modern ) urban developers, by fire and flood, and just by time.

In those countries where dialect study is undertaken, dialectologists observe that there are today many factors militating against the strict maintenance of older dialect boundaries: the standardization of terminology as adopted by national periodicals, news services, radio, and television; the establishment of prestige dialects and, through the media, their promulgation; and the huge population shifts that have taken place, particularly in the U.S. since WWII. Such shifts have been somewhat slower in England, but seem now to be speeding up.

I think I first bought a recording of Muskrat Ramble back in about 1940, when I was in my early teens. My memory is rickety, but I am sure my first recording was labeled MUSKRAT RAMBLE, and I think, though I am less sure, that it was played by the late Muggsy Spanier, who was, to my mind, one of the greatest of jazz trumpeters.

Although Yiddish has been in danger of dying out for hundreds of years, the language is spoken today by millions of people throughout the world— Russia, Poland, Rumania, France, England, Israel, Africa, Latin America, New Zealand, Australia, Canada, and the United States, where, like the bagel, it was leavened on both coasts, in New York and Hollywood. It is spoken even in Transylvania: A beautiful girl awakens in bed to find a vampire at her side.

My impression was that in the journals of desert explorers the word water, alone or in compounds, and words relating to water, were unusually frequent.

There is a quiet humor in Yiddish and a gratitude for every day of life, every crumb of success, each encounter of love.

All too often, children's disabilities are viewed as entirely biological, much like an incurable disease. Vygotsky's theory emphasizes that the most serious consequence of a physical or mental defect is not the biological impairment itself but the disruption it causes in the child's social relationships.

Trade data already suggest a major restructuring in the sources of U.S. apparel imports. The surge in apparel imports in the 1980s came from low-wage countries, primarily the Asian "Big Four"-the People's Republic of China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Korea.

Modern philosophical approaches toward equality all suffer from the same flaw. They are strongly committed, vaguely, to some position on the spectrum, but they offer no reason why they are so intensely committed to this value that has become so powerful in the English-speaking West.

It is not obvious, in fact, that the universe should be complex. One can imagine universes governed by general relativity that burst briefly into big bang being, then recollapse in a rapid big crunch within parts of a second or a century.

Evidence of such low sensitivity in an important subgroup may necessitate use of multiple screens tailored to subgroups. In addition to women, other subgroups such as adolescents, older adults, pregnant women, psychiatric patients, and Spanish speakers may need screening with modified or unique tests.

Down toward the river is the Museu Nacional do Azulejo (National Azulejo Museum), devoted entirely to the art of painted and glazed ceramic tiles, a national art form. About 12,000 azulejos are on show here, from 15th-century polychrome designs to 20th-century art deco.

Two trends over the past twenty-five years have compounded the problems inherent in the traditional retail model. First, product proliferation has vastly increased the number of products retailers are required to manage in their stores.

I am honored to have the opportunity to participate in this timely conference. It is my belief that our deliberations and discussion should greatly assist the articulation of a focused, thoughtful research agenda for addressing alcohol-related problems in the emergency department (ED) setting.

We, therefore, have a dilemma. Grant applications submitted by emergency medicine specialists that do not use the methodologic processes preferred by alcohol research study sections are usually going to lose when competing against grants submitted by recognized alcohol research specialists.

The assertion of a triadic conception of government brought us into line with the middle European conception of freedom as the privilege that arises from living in a matrix of protective state regulations. It is not nature but the law that makes us free.

Mies van der Rohe appears in a photograph taken in 1926. The place is Stuttgart, the site of the famous Weissenhof housing exhibition, which he planned, and where he brought together the leading exponents of the soon-to-be-christened International Style.

As we have indicated, guidelines and best practices have been published that deal with alcohol dependence and abuse and emergency medicine. The challenge now is to discover how government agencies and professional organizations can promote adoption and implementation of intervention guidelines.

It is interesting to look at the makeup of these welfare gains. In the Thress model, at the discount level of 8¢ and the net gain of $32 million, the basic market incurs a welfare loss of $480 million (0.

In fact, the hypercycle is a small society of molecular replicators that help one another replicate, hence, it is a higher-order molecular replicating system. Reza Ghadiri has nearly created a peptide hypercycle and probably soon will achieve a real experimental example.
