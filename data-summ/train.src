One is entitled to speculate on what outrageous proposal the narrator had made in Proust's Remembrance of Things Past, Vol. 2 — Cities of the Plain ( translated by C. K. Scott Moncrieff— Modern Library, N.Y., 1934, Page 90 ) to cause the Duchess to say, Apart from your balls, can't I be of any use to you? There is a famous letter penned by Rupert Brooke to his friend, Edward Marsh, from somewhere near Fiji ( p. 463 of A Treasury of the World's Great Letters, Simon and Schuster, N.Y., 1940 ) in which he relates how he sends his native boy up a palm tree, where he cuts off a couple of vast nuts...

The story of the 509th is a tale of an elite outfit that lived in a bubble of secrecy and endured the taunts of other war - weary U.S. units that resented sharing a small Pacific island with the 509th, which appeared exempt from combat. Tinian Island was the staging area where the 509th moved after its creation in the desert.

Giuliani's estrangement from his wife, Donna Hanover, is made clear in an interview with Hanover that appears in today's New York Times. Hanover " would not say whether Giuliani would run for the Senate, whether she would like him to run for Senate, or whether she would campaign for him if he did. But she did say in the interview, which was conducted before the recent frenzy of speculation about Hillary Rodham Clinton's interest in the same New York Senate seat, that Mrs. Clinton is a ' very interesting ' person.

This is very economical of space and involves a clever computer ploy, but it does not provide a particularly useful synonym dictionary, for, as we all know, synonymy in language does not yield to the commutative law of mathematics; in language, Things equal to the same thing are not ( necessarily ) equal to each other. Perhaps the Proximity people thought that they had got round that little problem by giving the same definition for each of the items in the list; but we know that only very rarely are two synonyms bi-unique ( which is another way of saying that if A = B, B does not necessarily always equal A ), an ineluctable fact of language.

It would be nice to think that while linguists were working so hard to organize languages, they were working alongside the archaeologists who were providing the raw materials. But only rarely did they collaborate and, with few exceptions, their work was not correlated in a systematic way.

The Wall Street Journal " Outlook " observes, " In the U.S. job market, the balance of power is shifting to employees from employers, " and states that " the retention frenzy was triggered in part by previous waves of corporate downsizing, " which left behind survivors who took stock of career options and used Internet job listings and intensified recruiting to land better offers, which in turn led to counter-offers and higher salaries. This has led, says the Journal, to annual compensation rising 5 - 6 percent a year.

Claiborne investigates and reports on expressions like sow one's wild oats, about which he tells us little or nothing: the modern Latinate designation Avena fatua came too many centuries after the original expression to have any relevance to it, so why bring up the information that fatua is Latin for ` foolish ': it was also Latin for ` wild, ' which might be more to the point. In any event, it is hard to discern, from the arch style affected in an attempt to make dull facts interesting, just what is the origin of sow one's wild oats.

For the most part, the book consists of a rewriting of history, from the dawn of time, with the purpose of demonstrating two main themes: the fact that women were responsible for all the important contributions to the advancement of civilization ( as the development of agriculture, for instance ), often despite the arrogance and stupidity of men; and the fact that women have long been subjected to domination by men. Miles suggests that such domination is a recent phenomenon—only a couple of thousand years old—for she points to the clear superiority of women in ( primitive ) religions and matriarchies, right on through to the Egyptian dynastic rulers.

I tried another explorer, Ernest Giles. Taking page 17 again, I was reminded that Giles is rather given to semi-serious poetic diction at times, and we find him referring to the presence of water in the Finke River as the stream purling over its stony floor or, quoting some bygone poet, brightly the brook through the green leaflets, giddy with joyousness, dances along.

While I did not attend the trial-- I was lucky to be able to read your highly amusing and informative dispatches, several of which made me spit up my lunch laughing--it certainly seemed as if the image of Bill Gates took a beating and the insular culture of Microsoft did not look so good. That's ironic, since I think it was just that insularity that helped them, much in the same way that AOL has benefited from being in the Virginia suburbs rather than in Silicon Valley.

The languages discussed here are what are usually called the Indo- European family; similar family trees could be drawn for the Semitic languages, Sino- Tibetan, Japanese, Bantu, Malayo- Polynesian, and so on. Each is a distinct phylum; although there may be word-borrowing among them, lexicon is considered less important in the classification of languages than structure and grammar.

From where I am sitting, I think the Microsoft trial has been the really obvious turning point between the computer era and the digital age. I think it almost does not matter what the judge does since it's clear that the balance of power is shifting again, although it not clear where it will land.

Campbell held that the ancient mythologies and religions are allegorical and that there was no real distinction between gods and goddesses, who were given sexual identity when in human form only to make them more meaningful. With all respect, that seems a highly debatable issue and one far too complex for this discussion, though we can certainly trace a diminution in the role of female divinities ( or divinity ) when we come to examine Judaism and its congeners and progeny.

Finally, the committee appeared to have discounted Torricelli's contention that he was not responsible for expensive earrings that Chang had given as Christmas gifts to his sister, Stern and Balaban.

Chatterbox feels a little dense for not realizing sooner that the subtext ( and hence much of the appeal ) of a Hillary Clinton- Rudy Giuliani Senate race would be Wronged Wife vs. Neglectful Husband.

In Thomas Hardy's The Hand of Ethelberta, it is suggested by Ethelberta that she and some others go to see Milton's tomb in Cripplegate church. Her suitor, Neigh, who had proposed marriage in a previous chapter, appears somewhat apprehensive at Ethelberta's suggestion.

Here's another story of success from what might seem like an unlikely source: Goodwill's controller, Juli. She tells me that the 3,666 people we helped find jobs in 1998 earned approximately $49 million dollars.

The court, vacating Nelson's death sentence for the second time, ruled on two grounds: that the jury could have been confused by instructions on the verdict sheet and that the prosecutor made improper accusations in his closing argument. Nelson, 44, had been the only woman of 14 people on New Jersey's death row.

All of which is to say that the book is an interesting work on the language and contains accurate, though longwinded information about what it covers, interesting and useful facts about American English. Its only real faults are its title, which belies the content, the cutesy headings, and the lack of a truly detailed index: self-indexing does not provide coverage of sufficient detail.

We built our first hut more than 100 years ago in New Hampshire’s northern Presidential Range, and we helped protect the White Mountains so that they are still open to you now. Today our unique network of 10 huts and lodges—each a day’s hike apart—stretches 56 miles through the White Mountain National Forest.

My theory is that the r got put in there simply because muskrat is a more common word than muscat. It is the same reason most of us, I assume, have heard, He's in the hospital with prostrate trouble. Prostrate is a more common word that prostate, so prostrate is what we get.

I made up my mind that Muscat Ramble was almost certainly the original name of the tune. My reasoning is that it is not likely that Kid Ory or Ray Gilbert had ever seen a muskrat, and it's even less likely that they or anyone else has ever seen a muskrat doing anything that we would be likely to think of as rambling.

The city also needs to begin openly discussing what happens underground, in particular with the transportation network. At this point, planners have focused on short-term repair of PATH and subway lines, with medium-range proposals being shopped in Washington that could untangle the disorganized web of subway lines downtown.

According to the blurb on the dust jacket of this distinctly unpleasant book, Rosalind Miles is head of the Centre for Women's Studies at Coventry Polytechnic, a lecturer, broadcaster, journalist, and author of several other books, including a highly acclaimed biography of Ben Jonson. One might like to believe that this gives her the cachet of authoritative scholarship, but the text does not bear out the promise.

One concrete example is a joint project undertaken in the United Northwest Area in partnership with The Junior League of Indianapolis and Community Partnerships with Youth from Fort Wayne, Indiana.

Since this linguistic-statistical study of an obsession might well prove to be an important contribution to psycholinguistics, I decided to make a larger sample of watery words, choosing the straightforward journals of Colonel Peter Egerton Warburton, who led an expedition across the western interior of Australia in 1873 - 4. In a randomly chosen sequence of ten pages ( 151 - 60 of the published journal ) there were twenty-eight occurrences of the word water ( eight of them in compounds ), no page being without at least one example.

I have no quarrel with Renfrew's theory—notwithstanding the generally received wisdom that has placed the homeland north of the Black Sea region and the Volga steppes. It is difficult for the nonspecialist reader ( like me ) to assess the validity of his arguments, which are based on his contention that the language ( and its congeners ) were carried along by the spread of nomad pastoralism.

It is difficult for the nonspecialist reader ( like me ) to assess the validity of his arguments, which are based on his contention that the language ( and its congeners ) were carried along by the spread of nomad pastoralism.

Timex had requested duty - free treatment for many types of watches, covered by 58 different U.S. tariff classifications.

Penny Perrick regrets ( January 11 ) that There is no word in English to describe that particular, special sort of pride that one feels in the achievements of one's children.

Family words and expressions crop up everywhere.

Israeli security officials believed that the murdered real-estate dealer was executed by plainclothes Palestinian Authority police. The Palestinian Authority's decision to make the sale of land to Jews a capital crime reflects Palestinian frustration with Israeli land use, specifically the creation of a new Jewish neighborhood now under construction in East Jerusalem.

One way to explain a persistent accelerating expansion of a flat universe is to reintroduce Einstein's "cosmological constant" into the field equations of general relativity. A positive cosmological constant expresses itself as a repulsive force between masses that increases with the distance between those masses.

Then one can imagine a sum over all histories that, by constructive interference alone, picks those pathways, hence fundamental amplitude laws, that minimize the change in the ways amplitudes propagate. Such pathways would have similar phase, hence, accumulate amplitude by constructive interference.

During the preschool and elementary school years, thought is largely tied to the here-and-now. Children think in an organized fashion about concrete information they can directly perceive but have great difficulty reasoning about hypothetical situations-ones that do not make sense in the real world.

There is little reason to believe that intoxicated patients who present to the emergency department represent a special population to whom current research results do not apply. Patients with alcohol problems experience an average of 1.32 injury-related events requiring outpatient or inpatient care per year.

There are two major types of sewing machines used in garment assembly: the lockstitch and the chain-stitch machine. Each type feeds in separate threads above and below the fabric, and these two threads must be connected in some fashion to form a stitch.

I turn next to an outsider's grounds for doubts about some of the core propositions of quantum mechanics. Roland Omnes, in The Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics, is at pains to argue that decoherence is the plausible route to classicity.

Rather than teaching didactically, teachers in Piagetian-based settings provide a rich variety of hands-on activities and encourage children's exploration and experimentation.

Clarke wrote Berger on January 11, 2000, that the CIA, the FBI, Justice, and the NSC staff had come to two main conclusions. First, U.S. disruption efforts thus far had "not put too much of a dent" in Bin Ladin's network.

As American history took its course in the decades that followed the "war for the nation," we managed to betray the inner meaning of the great sacrifice that Lincoln sought to consecrate at Gettysburg. We absorbed the war into the preexisting political and legal vocabulary.
